              %p
                Amy Glasmeier is a professor of economic geography and regional planning. She runs LRISA, the lab on Regional Innovation and Spatial Analysis, in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning. She is a faculty Co-I on the post traumatic stress innovations project of the SSRC, where she and her students are studying the challenges of accessing mental health care and other support programs by members of the Marines and Navy, stationed at Camp Lejeune, NC. Glasmeier is a founding editor of the Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy, Society, an off shoot of the Cambridge Journal of Economics. She serves on numerous journal editorial boards and organizations. Glasmeier’s research focuses on the spatial interactions of economic actors and structures including firms, industries, institutions and the state in the provision of economic opportunity for communities and individuals. The work investigates the role of access and the effect of locational accident, which encumbers human development.

                She is currently writing a textbook on the Economic Geography of the Global Energy Economy where she is capturing the interplay among resources, technology, state-led development trajectories and the challenges of the resource curse, path dependence and technological lock-in. Her other project, “Good Bye American Dream” traces the ideology of opportunity which undergirds America’s relationship to the poor. Through analysis of census data, popular media, and personal narratives Glasmeier is seeking to expose the contradictions in the most sacred of constructs by demonstrating the ephemeral nature of economic opportunity encumbered as it is by locational accident, institutional inertia and unintended consequences of public policy. The work builds off of her long operating Living Wage Calculator, www.livingwagecalculator@mit.edu, which analyzes the minimum level of income required for individuals and families to pay for basic living expenses.

                Carey Anne Nadeau is currently pursuing a Master's Degree in City Planning at the Department of Urban Studies and Planning, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (expected to graduate February 2015). Her Master’s thesis investigates the extent to which low wages and the ability to budget for public transportation to work act as a barrier to employment for low-income families. Concurrently, she is working at the Lab for Regional Innovation and Spatial Analysis along with Professor Amy Glasmeier to quantify the cost of living for families in US metropolitan areas.

                Previously, Nadeau worked as a Research Analyst at the Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program, focusing on comparative analyses of human geography and human capital in metropolitan areas. Prior to joining the Brookings Institution, she worked as a Research Assistant at the Urban Institute’s Justice Policy Center to analyze policies and programs targeted towards low-income individuals involved with the criminal justice system. Nadeau has also served as a Senior Mentor for Fellows in the Brookings-Urban Institute Summer Academy to advise research on American Indian tribal policy.

                Eric Schultheis
              %p
                Eric Schultheis is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His broad areas of interest include spatial analysis, geographic information systems (GIS), applications of IT in government and non-profit organizations, mixed-method research, applied critical realism, domestic poverty, anti-poverty law, and federally subsidized low-income rental housing policy, law, and history. In particular, his research focuses on (1) how public and non-profit organizations can leverage information technology and administrative data to better serve client populations and (2) how to evaluate the accessibility of social services in a manner that accounts for how spatial, social, and institutional factors impact service accessibility. Prior to beginning his doctoral studies, Schultheis practiced anti-poverty law for several years in Northern California. His practice was split between impact work and the representation of individual clients. His impact practice focused on how mapping and data visualization could be used in advocacy, community building and program evaluation. His individual client practice focused on representing households that participated in the public housing and "Section 8" programs in a variety of administrative and landlord/tenant issues.
